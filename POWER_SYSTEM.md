## Gameplay Strategy Tips

### Early Game
1. Focus on unlocking basic generators first (Solar, Wind, Fossil Fuel)
2. Earn coins and achievements to gain Skill Points
3. Save coins for expensive generators

### Mid Game
1. Start accumulating Skill Points from achievements
2. Decide whether to unlock Solar Farm or Wind Farm technology
3. Buy upgrades for unlocked farm generators to boost power
4. Balance power generation with server energy needs (2 power per server)

### Late Game
1. Unlock both farm technologies if you want maximum flexibility
2. Upgrade farm generators multiple times for exponential power growth
3. Work toward filling all 16 grid slots with optimal generators
4. Purchase advanced generators (Nuclear, Fusion)
5. Eventually unlock and upgrade Dyson Sphere for massive power generation

### Advanced Strategy
- **Renewable Path**: Unlock and heavily upgrade Solar/Wind Farms
- **Balanced Path**: Mix different generator types for diverse power
- **Late Game Path**: Save for Dyson Sphere and focus on its upgrades
- **Power Economy**: Remember servers consume 2 power each; plan accordingly

## Generator Upgrade Mechanics

Upgradable generators follow exponential growth:
- Each upgrade costs `baseUpgradeCost × 1.3^level`
- Each upgrade multiplies power output by 1.5x
- At level 5: Power is 1.5^5 = 7.59x base power
- At level 10: Power is 1.5^10 = 57.67x base power

This creates a compelling upgrade path with meaningful progression!

## Balance Notes

- Grid limited to 16 slots (3x4 grid shown in Power tab)
- Power cost: 2 per server
- Insufficient power reduces production by 50%
- Research unlocks are permanent (transfer between resets)
- Skill Points earned per prestige are based on achievements
